# EngagementTest


The company of this exercise is a social network. They decided to add a feature called: Recommended Friends, i.e. they suggest people you may know.

A data scientist has built a model to suggest 5 people to each user. These potential friends will be shown on the user newsfeed. At ﬁrst, the model is tested just on a random subset of users to see how it performs compared to the newsfeed without the new feature.

The test has been running for some time and your boss asks you to check the results. You are asked to check, for each user, the number of pages visited during their ﬁrst session since the test started. If this number increased, the test is a success.
